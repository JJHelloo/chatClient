To fullfil the webserver requirement:

CAbash.sh can live in the CST311/ folder on the mininet VM that is running the emulation.

When running CAbash.sh:
Server CN entered during root CA creation needs to be ca.csumb.test
** Get a screen capture of the last cert decryption that displays, labeled in the script as "GET A SCREEN SHOT FOR SUBMISSION"

Modify existing config file on VM:
The VM host file on the machine we are running the emulation on needs to be updated:
nano /etc/hosts

The host file on Replit defines what needs to change, it needs to match our topology.

Enabling webserver on h2:
sslwebserver.py can be stored in CST311/ folder, but needs to be run on h2 (webserver)

Submission requirements:

from one of the hosts, run wget https://www.webpa4.test:4443
**we need a screen capture of a successful wget

** noted above for CAbash.sh
